 <h2>Shane-Michael Thompson</h2>
 <p>I am student of The University of The West Indies. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Software Engineering,
     and I am a Graphic Designer. My hobbies include designing, creating videos, and also gaming. I am interested in doing
     Web Development, as I believe it is a useful skill in all aspects of life, to be able to market myself online by creating
     websites, not only for myself, but others who may need them. I believe this will work hand-in-hand with my graphic design hobby, as
     it should help me in the conceptualizing of a website, and assist in marketing my abilities.</p>
